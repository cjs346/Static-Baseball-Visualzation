SF,AT&T Park,339,404,399,421,330,San Francisco Giants,"253, 90, 30","0, 0, 0","Here at AT&T Park we see a major concetration of both home and away homeruns across left field. This usually highlights the closer distance to homeplate that area of the field has over the right end, left field is 20 feet closer than right field."
STL,Busch Stadium,336,375,400,375,335,St. Louis Cardinals,"196, 30, 58","0, 0, 102",Busch Stadium has equidistant center field to homeplate distances. The evenly distributed home and away homeruns from almost the entire distance of the field highlights this.

"
DET,Comerica Park,345,370,420,365,330,Detroit Tigers,"12, 44, 86","12, 44, 86",Another Park with a center field farther from homeplate than the other areas of concetrated homeruns. With the Detroit Tigers responsible for on average half of the homeruns on the field.
COL,Coors Field,347,390,415,375,350,Colorado Rockies,"51, 51, 102","35, 31, 32","Coors Field, home of the Colorado Rockies, has a large concentration of homeruns on both left-center and right-center field. However the homeruns tend to be more concentrated closer to the fence on right field as opposed to left."
LAD,Dodger Stadium,330,385,395,385,330,Los Angeles Dodgers,"239, 62, 66","0, 90, 156","Dodger Stadium has an almost even distribution of homeruns from both the home team, the LA Dodgers, and the away teams. "
